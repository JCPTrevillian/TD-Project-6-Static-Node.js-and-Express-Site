Static Node.js and Express Site 

In this project I will use Node.js and Express and Pug templates to create a portfolio site to show off the projects i've built in earlier Unit courses. 

Node.js and Express make a powerful pair when used together on the server side, and are used everyday to make fast, modular and dynamic web applications.
